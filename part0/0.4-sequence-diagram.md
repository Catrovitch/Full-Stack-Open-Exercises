    participant Server

    Browser->>Server: HTTP POST to address "/new_note"
    Server->>Browser: HTTP Status 302 (Redirect) Location: "/notes"

    Note over Browser, The redirect causes the browser to make a new HTTP GET request to what was given as the Location. In this case: "/notes".
    Note over Browser, The request causes the browser to reload, which causes three more HTTP requests as seen below. 
    Browser->>Server: Fetch main.css
    Server-->>Browser: main.css file
    Browser->>Server: Fetch main.js
    Server-->>Browser: main.js file
    Browser->>Server: Fetch data.json
    Server-->>Browser: raw data of notes
